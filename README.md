# Peer-Evaluation

The MERN Stack Peer Evaluation System is an interactive platform for student presentations and evaluations. It allows students to upload their presentation materials, receive feedback from their peers and professors, and track their progress over time. The system is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

**Please note that the code implementation is not yet complete and requires refactoring.**

- Scoring and feedback: Evaluators can assign scores, provide feedback, and comments to presenters.
- Personalized feedback reports: The system generates comprehensive feedback reports for each student, summarizing scores, comments, and areas for improvement.
- Easy collaboration: Students can engage in peer-to-peer evaluations and post-presentation discussions to enhance learning and exchange insights.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building APIs.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side applications.
- React Router: A library for routing in React applications.
- Bootstrap: A CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
- react-reveal: A library for creating animated UI components.
- React Context: A feature of React for managing global state.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atinafabebe1/Peer-evaluation.git


2. Install the dependencies for the backend:

   ```bash
   cd StudentAssess/api
   npm install

3. Install the dependencies for the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../ui
   npm install

7. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## TODO

- Refactor code implementation to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Implement global state management using React Context for better state management across components.
